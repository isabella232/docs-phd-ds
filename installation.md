#Prerequisites

Before you begin your [Pivotal HD for Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-hd-service) deployment, make sure that your system meets the following minimum requirements:

* An installed instance of [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) Ops Manager v1.3.2.0
* Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; Elastic Runtime installed in Ops Manger
* Network access and credentials for the Ops Manager Web Console
* 7 IP Addresses in the vSphere Network where you plan to deploy the Pivotal HD Service Broker. See [Configuring Network Segmentation in Ops Manger](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/network-segmentation.html) in the PCF documentation.
* Capacity in the vSphere cluster, resource pool, and datastore for the Pivotal HD Service Broker and related virtual machines as follows:

* A sufficient number of IP Address for the maximum number of Pivotal HD Clusters you will allow PCF users to create. Use the following formula to calculate the number of IP addresses:

<strong>Number of Clusters</strong> * (<strong>Number of PHD Components</strong> + <strong>Number of Slave VMs</strong> + <strong>2 Compilation VMs</strong>)

Where the **Number of PHD Components** is one component for each of the following software services you choose to deploy in your On-Demand cluster: NameNode, HDFS, HAWQ, YARN, GemFire XD.

#Installation Steps
<ol>
        <li>Download the Pivotal HD Service's 1.3.2.0 software binary from
            <a  href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-hd-service">The Pivotal Network</a>. </li>
        <li>Use a Web browser to log in to the <strong>Pivotal Ops Manager</strong> application. (This application is part of your PCF installation.) <p>The <strong>Ops Manager Installation Dashboard</strong> displays:</p>
            <p> <img
                alt="Ops Manager"
                src="images/ops_manager_large.png" /></p>

        <li> Click  <strong>Import a Product</strong>. <p> The <strong>Add Products</strong> screen displays.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Click <strong>Choose File</strong> and navigate to the file you downloaded. <p>The file uploads to your PCF deployment. </p>
        </li>
        <li> Click <strong>Add</strong>. <p>Pivotal Ops Manager adds a new tile for Pivotal HD Service to the Installation Dashboard. </p>
        </li>

        <li>Select the <strong>Pivotal HD for PCF</strong> tile.<p>The <strong>Pivotal HD</strong> configuration page displays. </p></li>
            <li> (Optional) Select <strong>Assign Availability Zones</strong> to configure which Availability Zone you want Ops Manager to use to deploy the Pivotal HD Service Broker and virtual machines.  The Pivotal HD Service Broker and related VMs are all singleton jobs, meaning that only one virtual machine is deployed for each type.  The only exception is the compilation job, which deploys two virtual machines. <p>See <a
                        href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/vsphere-config.html">Configuring BOSH Director for VMware vSphere </a></p></li>
            <li>(Optional) Select the <strong>Assign Networks</strong> tab if you want to change the vSphere Network where Ops Manager deploys the Pivotal HD Service Broker and related virtual machines.</span>
            </li>
        <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
        <li>

The default Service Plan defines a Pivotal HD cluster that includes HDFS, YARN/MapReduce, HAWQ, and deploys up to three five-node clusters comprised of the four component’s master processes and one VM running all components’ slave processes. You can use the default Service Plan as-is, or you can modify the Service Plan for your requirements. See <a

            <p> During this installation, Ops Manager deploys a virtual machine to run the Pivotal HD Service Broker.  A progress meter displays the progress of the installation.
           When the installation is complete, the Pivotal HD Service Broker deploys the configured number of pre-created instances of Pivotal HD for each configured On-Demand Service Plan.</p>
            <p>To create cluster instances, see <a

    </ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can access information about these deployments from the BOSH command-line interface and not from the Ops Manager console. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once the pre-created Pivotal HD instances are deployed, the Pivotal HD Service broker automatically registers the service in the Elastic Runtime Marketplace.  Once the service is registered, PCF users can create instances of the configured service plans.

#About vSphere Networking Configurations

This section describes vSphere configurations that you define on the **Network Settings** page.

When configuring the Pivotal HD Service, you define which vSphere network you want the Pivotal Service Broker to use when deploying the virtual machines that comprise each Pivotal HD cluster.  This network can either be the same or different as the one you have configured Operations Manager to use when deploying PCF.

Consider the following vSphere network diagram:

##Deploying Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; and Pivotal HD on the Same Network

If Operations Manager has been configured to deploy PCF and any imported Services to network A in the picture above, you can configure the Pivotal HD Service to also deploy Pivotal HD clusters to network A.  If you choose to use the same network as PCF, it is likely you will use IP addresses from a single IP subnet across all deployments.  Should you choose to use IP addresses from the same subnet, you must ensure that Operations Manager and the Pivotal HD Service do not attempt to use the same IP addresses in their deployments.

To achieve this, you must exclude the IP range you want the Pivotal HD deployments to use in the Ops Manager vSphere network settings and you must exclude the IP range you want Ops Manager deployments to use in the Pivotal HD Service's network settings.

Here is an example of how you might do that if you were deploying everything to the IP subnet 10.0.0.0/16.  In this example, we are reserving the first 512 IP Addresses for Operations Manager and the next 512 IP addresses for the Pivotal HD Service.

**vSphere Network Settings Tab:**

* Network Name: `vSphereNetwork_A`
* IP Address Subnet: `10.0.0.0/16`
* Excluded IP Address Range: `10.0.2.1-10.0.3.254` (IP addresses s you want the Pivotal HD Service to use in Pivotal HD deployments)
* DNS Servers: `8.8.8.8`
* Default Gateway IP Address: `10.0.0.1`

**Pivotal HD Service Network Settings Tab:**

* Network Name: `vSphereNetwork_A`
* IP Address Subnet: `10.0.0.0/16`
* Excluded IP Address Range: `10.0.0.1-10.0.2.0`  (IPs you want Operations Mgr to use in PCF deployments)
* DNS Servers: `8.8.8.8`
* Default Gateway IP Address: `10.0.0.1`

##Deploying Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; and Pivotal HD on Different Networks

Alternatively, you could configure Ops Manager to deploy Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; to Network A and the Pivotal HD Service to deploy Pivotal HD clusters to Network C.  The only requirement in this case is that the two networks be able to route traffic to each other.  If a firewall is placed between the two networks, you must ensure that these ports are opened to allow unrestricted traffic between the BOSH agent and director:
